## README
Note: This application is based on the Pixel 3XL, API30 version.
### <With Pallete,measure your personal color>
- Measure your personal color with just A4 paper and a smartphone for FREE.

#### What is Personal Color?
- Personal color is defined in four different tones using the names of the seasons, and consists of warm orange skin tone warm tone and pale pinkish cool tone.
#### The Need for this application
- The largest percentage of Korean smartphone usage time is also in their teens and 20s, and this personal color is gaining sensational popularity on SNS used by the age group.
- However, the cost of diagnosing personal colors ranges from 30,000 won to 150,000 won, which is a bit burdensome for the age group.
- It was not that these applications did not exist at all, but after looking at several applications, we found that white-balancing is not working properly and often results in inaccurate results.
